Hey, I'm Chrisüëãüèª I'm currently a PhD student at the [Chair of Automatic Control Engieering](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lsr/home/) at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/).

My research interests include Online Convex Optimization/Nonstochastic Control, Learning-based and Adaptive Control, and Reinforcement Learning.

I've obtained my master's degree in [Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/robotics-cognition-intelligence-master-of-science-msc) from [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/). During my masters, I had the opportunity to be an exchange student at the [Johou Systems Kougaku (JSK) Laboratory](http://www.jsk.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/information.html) at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), Japan, under the supervision of [Prof. Kei Okada](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=456Oe4YAAAAJ&hl=en).

Prior to that, I've been a corporate student at [Robert Bosch GmbH](https://www.bosch.de/en/), where I worked in different departments in Abstatt, Curitiba (Brazil), and Renningen.
